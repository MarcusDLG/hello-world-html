      Hello friends, and welcome to the Masters at Augusta National!
    </h1>
    <p>
      While this will not be a paragraph about how golf is instrumental in my
      bag of hobbies, lately it has been replaced by the building and flying of
      drones. While I know that this is a hobby that takes a ton of time and
      practice, I am committed to learning more and more each day. I cannot wait
      to be done with coding school so that I can get back to flying an hour a
      day, but also have a better knowledge base so that I can better program my
      flight controllers. I love working with hardware and soldering, and would
      love to find a way to link my hardware and software knowledge.
